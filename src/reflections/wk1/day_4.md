## Daily Journal
Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions

### What is the purpose of wire-framing?
>Wireframes keep the concept user-focused,clarify and define website features and are quick and cheap to create

### What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
>low, mid and high fidelity wireframes.

>low: The lack of details makes it easy work out navigation and basic needs for the site. Also makes it easy to discuss the project with people who lack develper training.

>mid:The introduction to more detials helps to add clearity to the project so that there isnt any misunderstanding between client and develper. The fact that they are widely used and have recouses like https://www.sketch.com/ and https://balsamiq.com/ 

>high:The fullest detail wire frame is perfect for exploring and documenting complex concepts such as menu systems or interactive maps. When making high fidelity wire frames sites like https://www.figma.com/ are extremely useful

### Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
>I believe wire frames are worth the time, energy and effort because with the big picture in mind you can make sure all your efforts are working towards that final goal vs working on parts independantly and realized after that the way you created that part isnt the most effiecent way to get your site looking as it should. I picture it like drawing a figure you start out with a form then fill in smaller details because you know how they fit in vs spending time on a detail like the eyes only to realize you have them out or perportion or in the wrong place in relation to the rest of the drawing.

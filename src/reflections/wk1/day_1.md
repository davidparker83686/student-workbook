### Why do we use Git?
> Using Git allows for mulitple people to work on the same project. Using Git also allows us to go back to a previous version of our code if our project requirements have changed.

#### What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
> It allows the same code to be worked on at the same time. This creates the branches that could be merged later. 

##### What is the difference between Git and GitHub
 >Git is the process of my code in "snapshots" of where my code is at that moment. Github is just a cloud that we save our changes

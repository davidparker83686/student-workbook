Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
```
Unit Testing, a test on component of code via a written test.
Component Testing, a test on a small bit of code via use of a testing framework. 
End-To-End (E2E) Testing, a test from front end to back end via fron and back end code already written.
```
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
```
End-To-End (E2E) Testing, because it tests the code along with the back end portion of it. The test also functions in a way testing the code and the actual interaction that the user would experience. Also nothing new is needed to test this. 
```
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
```
Unit Testing, because the need to create a test and I personally have never done that and wouldnt know where to begin. The test is also time spend creating something that wont ever be used again post test.

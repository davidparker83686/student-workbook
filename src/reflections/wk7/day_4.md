# CHECKPOINT

Daily Journal
Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions
## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
```
We kept our user in mind when creating the project making sure it met accessiblity requirements and by the nature of the project we did some Pair Programming. 
```
## What went well?
```
I think our Pair Programming went really well, we both brought a different way of working and our skill sets to the project. I know I wouldnt have created as strong of a project without my partner. 
```
## What would you do differently?
```
It would have been nice to include Code documentation with our project considering I know im going to want to make edits to our code for my portfolio and will want jump back in without spending a whole lot of time looking over my code.

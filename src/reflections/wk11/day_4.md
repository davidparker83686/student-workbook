So far I would say Ive had a Positive Experience and have felt that Ive been well equip for every check point leading up to this. However Im nervous going into the final, the idea that i havent missed any points on any acheck point and have for the most part completed all teh Requirements on them to then flunk out of the course because of one project is stressful. College finals dont even hold that much weight. I also feel Incredibly shaky on c# so thats adding to alot of the stress i feel. I plan to time box and give myself brakes when I feel like giving up. This project is a Marathon not a sprint so I need to make sure I dont burn out. 
So far Ive enjoyed all the new Knowledge Ive gained that has provided me with a Completely different view on sites that i didnt have before. Ive enjoyed the learning style alot with the lectures and actually Practicing in the lab being the main ways we learn considering I tend to have Difficulty learning Solely by reading.

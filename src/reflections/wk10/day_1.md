Daily Journal
Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions
## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
```
Value type-type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.

Reference type-stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

Pointer type-The type specified before the * in a pointer type is called the referent type. Only an unmanaged type can be a referent type.

# Day 4 - WORKING IN MVC WITH COMPLEX DATA, ARRAY METHODS

Read Advancing with JS > The Observer Pattern and answer the following questions


### What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
```
The need to update a page using the same data for which the code for can get very dense and cluttered. 
```
### What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
```
The Subscribe, The Unsubscribe, and The Broadcast Method
```

### Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

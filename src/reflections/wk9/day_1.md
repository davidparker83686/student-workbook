# Day 1 - CAPSTONES

Daily Journal
Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
```
Javascript, css, vue, html, nodeJs, git, mongodb, auth0
```
## What went well so far?
```
Our planning and talking over data relationships worked well. Ourstand ups have been going really well aswell. 
```
## What would you do differently? Why?
```
Allowing ourselves to get to caught up with the future of the app vs the short term reality. Being conserned about how we were gonna do a get on our searches because of "well what about in the future when we have millions of items on the site doing a get all wont be the correct way of going about it...." or "well what if I want to pre barrow an item in washington so i need to provide an area and future dates". because those are all great concerns but they arent part of the mvp, while they seem like they are because we come to expect so much from our apps today.

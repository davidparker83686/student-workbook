What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
```
It allows you the ability to keep the big picture/ end goals in mind and to insure that all the code you write work towards that goal and dont end up veering off or blocking you later.
```
How do you find answers when you are stuck?
```
I fist look at code I've written previously to see if I can find anything that would be relevant to use in the current situation. I moved on to search engines to find info or methods I dont know that could be important/neccessary to the current situation. Finally after working on my own, reviewing past code and searching I ask for help from peers or anyone who would have better knowledge on the subject. 
```
From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

```
console.log
```
Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

```
The Elements Tab, While in the Elements tab you can directly interact with the DOM and visually check if they work how expected.
```
Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

```
Using break or a debugger to your code will allow you to stop at a specific spot in code. Use of debugger at the top of your code will allow you to step line by line though your code.
